    <p class="bio"> Hey! I am a sophomore mojoring in Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am in this major for the money! Just Kidding, I like the subject too. I love adventures, and I want to have both spontaneous days and planned days in my life. Well, I am still choosing to work in a desk job. No, but, honestly, I love being a part of this Computer Science world, and I am looking forward to be one on the inside and make a better change.

  <h2>My process of teaching dance to non-dancers</h2>
  <p class="description">Life sucks without some dancing. The Indian Student Asociation performed at the International Street Fair and they were all non-dancers! This <a href="https://youtu.be/Dkuf2v_2Ap4">video</a>. is my fun process, as the only dancer, of choreographing and teaching them the dance!</p>

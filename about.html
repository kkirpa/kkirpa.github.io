    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Lets begin with a professional introduction, shall we?  My interests are in Artificial Intelligence, Web Development, UI/UX Designing, and Virtual Reality. I have experience in Web Development through my courses in Digital Media. I have been taking multiple courses from Udemy, Edx, AWS and coursera to discover my interests and learn apart from school. During the summer I shortly worked on an app development for Khalsa Schools in the US. I was in the UX and Quality Assurance Testing team. Although I discontinued when I got back to school to not divide my focus. I am also working on several projects in Data Analysis and Machine Learning to explore my interest in that field. One of my strongest and unique skills is Communication skills. I am very social and I have good persuasion, understanding, and listening skills, that I have gained from multiple social work opportunities, leadership and team work opportunities as well as my work experience at school. I am actually working 2 jobs sling with school, one being a research assistant and the other being our school’s IT department’s Student Consultant.

		<h1>One, Two, Three, Four</h1>

		<h3>Description:</h3>
		<p>The following words describe the aching feeling thta arises from the fear of never being wanted for love</p>


	<p>One, Two, Three, Four<br>
	I count everyday, every minute, every second<br>
	When I can be safe, not touched anymore<br>
	By you, or him, or them.<br>
	I watch every road, every city on the map<br>
	where I can stand <br>
	Just far enough from your hands</p>

	<p>So just stop<br>
	Stop looking at me<br>
	Like I am yours to explore,<br>
	And please stop<br>
	forcing me to be who I am not<br>
	Stop making me feel I am crazy<br>
	And not worth a good touch.</p>

	<p>A touch, a caress,<br>
	Given with love,<br>
	wanted, not forceful, not hurtful.<br>
	That's probably too much to ask for<br>
	But still wanted,<br>
	because I am tired of you,<br>
	You disgust me,<br>
	So much that now I disgust myself<br>
	I am tired of myself. <br>
	I think I hate myself <br>
	with your hands around me.</p>

	<p>Those hands remind me of him, <br>
	His touch, his grab, his pull<br>
	That took me down, <br>
	Till i sank to the very bottom<br>
	Too far from the ray of light <br>
	That came through the window of my room<br>
	And on my face till I shut my eyes<br>
	To see your face again<br>
	And I shivered and cried a little <br>
	And waited for you to stop<br>
	Or the pounding of my heart.</p>

	<p>The pounding is so loud in my ears<br>
	But with no sound at all,<br>
	And it all looks fake to you.<br>
	It pounds every second, <br>
	Harder each time I listen<br>
	To the ticks of my clock <br>
	And count in my room<br>
	Ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine<br>
	Waiting for something to change,<br>
	To be loved, to be touched, <br>
	But never by you.</p>
